The Rainy Days project is a clothing store focusing on comfort and durability for a reasonable price. This was our first web-developement project from our the first year at Noroff.

## Description

Rainy Days is a clothing store that offers solid and comfortable clothes for a reasonable price. The site is supposed to have a clean, professional and simple look presenting all their products. Along with continuity in design. The content was already created for us, so there's no extra added content. There's also a contact page that opens concerns people might have regarding either work, a product, complaint or cooperation.

My main focus here is design, navigation and ui

## Built With

Visual Studio Code, HTML and CSS

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:/johannabid/Rainy_Days_CMS_edited.git
```

### Running

This project contains only static files, so it will pretty much run on all devices. Just go into the root folder where you cloned this repo, and double click on index.html to run the file in your browser.

## Contributing

No contributions have been added on the school project.

Our main goal was to establish respective sites and completing a checkout process for one product. That's the reason why only one project leads to the check out, which is Scott Shell Woman.
